## Task 01 – API Security Risk Analysis

### Objective
To evaluate the security posture of a RESTful API by identifying authentication weaknesses, authorization flaws, data exposure risks, and improper request handling mechanisms.

---

### Assessment Methodology

The assessment followed a structured workflow:

1. Endpoint Discovery & Enumeration  
2. Authentication Enforcement Testing  
3. Object-Level Authorization Validation  
4. HTTP Method Manipulation Testing  
5. Data Exposure Review  
6. Risk Severity Classification  
7. Business Impact Mapping  
8. Remediation Planning  

Testing was performed in a controlled and ethical environment using publicly accessible demonstration endpoints.

---

### Key Technical Findings

- Lack of authentication enforcement on sensitive endpoints  
- Broken Object Level Authorization (ID manipulation vulnerability)  
- Excessive data exposure in API responses  
- Improper HTTP method validation  
- Absence of rate limiting controls  

Each finding includes supporting evidence and structured documentation.

---

### Risk Analysis Approach

Vulnerabilities were assessed using:

- Likelihood Analysis  
- Impact Evaluation  
- Severity Categorization  
- OWASP API Security Top 10 Alignment  

This approach ensures technical findings are translated into measurable business risk.

---

### Business Impact Perspective

If similar issues existed in a production SaaS or enterprise API environment, potential consequences include:

- Unauthorized data disclosure  
- Regulatory non-compliance (GDPR / Data Protection frameworks)  
- Reputational damage  
- Financial penalties  
- Loss of customer trust  

Security is evaluated not only technically, but strategically.

---

## Documentation Standards

All task reports are:

- Professionally structured
- Written in formal technical language
- Evidence-supported with screenshots
- Organized for executive and technical readability
- Formatted in Times New Roman (Word submission standard)

The goal is industry-level clarity, not academic formatting.
