## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing API security risks in modern SaaS-based applications.  
The objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and propose mitigation strategies following industry best practices.

APIs are critical components of:
- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- SaaS platforms
- Third-party integrations

If APIs are insecure, attackers can:
- Access sensitive data
- Bypass authentication
- Abuse endpoints
- Perform Denial of Service attacks

## 🎯 Objective of the Task

The primary goals of this task were:

1. Understand API architecture and endpoints.
2. Identify common API security vulnerabilities.
3. Perform risk analysis based on impact and likelihood.
4. Provide mitigation recommendations.
5. Prepare a professional security assessment report.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step Work Done

### Step 1: API Structure Analysis
- Identified available endpoints.
- Reviewed request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Checked input parameters and headers.

### Step 2: Authentication & Authorization Testing
- Tested login and token-based authentication.
- Checked for broken authentication issues.
- Verified role-based access control.

### Step 3: Input Validation Testing
- Tested improper input handling.
- Checked for injection vulnerabilities.
- Observed error responses and system behavior.

### Step 4: Data Exposure Analysis
- Examined API responses.
- Checked for sensitive data leakage.
- Verified encryption usage (HTTPS).

### Step 5: Rate Limiting & Abuse Testing
- Tested repeated requests.
- Checked for brute-force protection.
- Evaluated throttling mechanisms.

### Step 6: Risk Assessment
Each vulnerability was analyzed based on:
- Severity (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- Impact on system
- Likelihood of exploitation

### Step 7: Mitigation Recommendations
Provided security recommendations such as:
- Implement strong authentication (JWT/OAuth2)
- Enable rate limiting
- Validate all inputs
- Use proper encryption
- Apply least privilege access control
